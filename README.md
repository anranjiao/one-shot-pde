# One-shot learning for solution operators of partial differential equations

The data and code for the paper [One-shot learning for solution operators of partial differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05512). arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.05512, 2021.

## Data

The datasets in the study are generated directly from the code in [data](data) folder. For the following experiments, the data can be found on OneDrive:
- [Data for 2D nonlinear Poisson with a circle cutout](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/anran_jiao_yale_edu/EkONQQgZ_GtFn99kg2qUiG8BZlhOxZd3ti2mfIHXOETXzw?e=nvoubZ) generated by COMSOL

## Code

The code for training the local solution operators, FPI, LOINN and cLOINN approaches can be found in [src](src). Each folder within this directory is named according to the PDEs. Files ending in "_G.py" is the code for training the local solution operators. Files ending with "FPI", "cLOINN", or "LOINN" correspond to each approach.
